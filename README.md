<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 The project lists 10 different countries for users. By accessing the details of the desired country, the user encounters the flag of that country, the country code and the button for more details. In addition, the user can favorite/unfavorite the countries they wanted to and can list and remove them within the saved page in the tabbar.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- With the help of a custom cell, the cell with the star icon and the name of the required country was designed.
- This cell has been added to the home page, which is the first option in the tab bar.
- With a similar design of the home page, it was possible to sort the cells which is saved.
- Thanks to 2 different methods added to the custom cell, adding to favorites and going to country details actions are provided.
- With a design similar to the saved page, it was possible to sort the cells recorded in the plain.
- Started to design and code detail page
    -  Thanks to SDWebImageSVGCoder, the necessary image was fetched and placed on the detail page, which was a challenging detail as I had not used pod packages before.
    - Other datas are fetched such as wikicode and country name from the relevant API. More info button has been added and it redirects with the help of wikicode to the wikipedia. 
    - The country name is fixed in the header.
    - Finally, the star button on the right of the header was designed and coded to add that country to favorites.

<!-- THINGS THAT COULD BE BETTER -->
## Things That Could Be Better
1. Kazakhistan country flag size can be optimized because its size or type are not like others
